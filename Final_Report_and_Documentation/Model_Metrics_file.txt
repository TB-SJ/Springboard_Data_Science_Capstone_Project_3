Model Metrics Summary – Brain Tumor Classification
===================================================

This project compares three different model architectures trained on MRI brain scan images to classify between tumor and no tumor cases.
Below are the evaluation results based on test set performance.

Model             | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Test Loss
------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------
MobileNetV2       | 0.95     | 0.97      | 1.00   | 0.98     | 0.14
Custom CNN        | 0.89     | 0.99      | 0.85   | 0.91     | 0.26
EfficientNetB0    | 0.68     | 1.00      | 0.55   | 0.71     | 0.85

Best Performing Model: MobileNetV2
- Highest F1-score (0.98), indicating excellent balance between precision and recall
- Perfect recall (1.00), minimizing false negatives (critical in medical applications)

Confusion Matrices (Test Set)
-----------------------------

MobileNetV2
Predicted →     No Tumor     Tumor
Actual
No Tumor            231         25
Tumor                 2         730

Custom CNN
Predicted →     No Tumor     Tumor
Actual
No Tumor            254          2
Tumor               109        625

EfficientNetB0
Predicted →     No Tumor     Tumor
Actual
No Tumor            185         71
Tumor               331        403

Notes:
- Recall was emphasized due to the medical context, where missing a tumor is more dangerous than a false positive.
- Custom CNN performed well but had significantly lower recall than MobileNetV2.
- EfficientNetB0 struggled with generalization on external test data despite fine-tuning, likely due to overfitting and lack of robustness to domain variation
